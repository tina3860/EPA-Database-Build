# EPA-Database-Build

My project focuses on creating a unified product inventory management database for Environmental Products & Accessories, LLC (EPA Sales) by integrating data from three systemsâ€”Shopify, Sage, and HubSpot. The database consolidates key entities like products, suppliers, inventory, sales, and categories, providing real-time visibility and streamlined operations. I designed an ER diagram, relational schema, and implemented it in MySQL, ensuring accurate relationships between entities and resolving many-to-many complexities. The system enables efficient data retrieval through optimized SQL queries, offering actionable insights for departments like sales, purchasing, and warehouse management. This project highlights my technical, organizational, and problem-solving skills in managing cross-functional data.
