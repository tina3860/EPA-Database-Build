# EPA-Database-Build
Environmental Products & Accessories (EPA) – Product Inventory Database

In this project, I designed and built a **centralized product inventory management database** for Environmental Products & Accessories (EPA), a small manufacturer and reseller of vacuum truck parts and related equipment. The business problem was that EPA was operating across **three disconnected systems (Shopify, Sage, HubSpot)**, which caused inconsistent product records, inaccurate inventory counts, and limited visibility into when items needed to be reordered. Instead of trying to untangle messy legacy data, I designed a clean database **from scratch** to support scalable operations and reporting. 

I created an **ERD and relational schema** centered around five core entities: **Product, Supplier, Category, Inventory, and Sales/Transactions**, ensuring data integrity through primary/foreign keys and clear one-to-many relationships. The database supports operational use cases like **real-time inventory tracking, reorder monitoring, supplier management, and sales trend analysis** across departments including purchasing, warehouse, sales, and leadership.  

To demonstrate business value, I wrote SQL queries that answer realistic reporting questions such as:

* identifying products sold after a certain date
* ranking products by revenue
* flagging items below reorder thresholds
* calculating revenue filtered by category and supplier location 

This project strengthened my ability to translate real-world business operations into structured data models, and reinforced the importance of detail and validation when building systems that drive decision-making.
